- **🚦 Traffic Management:** Deploys **Traefik v3** as a secure Reverse Proxy with auto-HTTPS.
- **🤖 Active Defense:** Installs **Crowdsec** to detect and ban malicious IPs automatically.
- **🔄 Auto-Pilot:** Configures **Unattended Upgrades** (OS) and **Watchtower** (Docker) for automatic security patching.
